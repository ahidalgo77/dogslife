Feeding your dog well is one of the most impactful things you can do for long-term health.

## Choose complete and balanced food
Look for the AAFCO statement on the label. This indicates the food meets basic nutritional needs for the stated life stage.

## Portion sizes matter
Overfeeding leads to joint strain and metabolic disease. Start with the label's recommendation and adjust based on body condition score.

## Hydration first
Fresh water should be available at all times. Wet food or a splash of warm water can encourage picky drinkers.

## Treats and toppers
Treats should be < 10% of daily calories. Nutritious toppers like sardines in water or plain pumpkin can add variety.

> When changing foods, transition slowly over 7â€“10 days to avoid GI upset.
