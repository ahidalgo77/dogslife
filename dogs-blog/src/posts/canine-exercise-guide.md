Exercise fuels physical and mental health.

- Young adults: 60–90 minutes daily
- Seniors: shorter, more frequent sessions
- Flat-faced breeds: avoid heat; keep sessions calm

### Enrichment ideas
Sniff walks, flirt pole play, puzzle feeders, and scent games are excellent boredom busters.

Remember to warm up and cool down to protect joints.
